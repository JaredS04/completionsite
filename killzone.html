   From the awesome intro, to the solid level design and gunplay for it's time, Killzone is an 
   absolute gem I wish Playstation/Guerrilla would bring back. The "Halo Killer" isn't anything like 
   it's competition, but feels pretty unique especially with the helghast faction. Gunplay and 
   movement isn't as smooth as Halo CE, but still feels good for the times. Being able to pick 1/4 
   characters each level is nice as well as being able to wield 2 primaries.
