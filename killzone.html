  <pre>
    From the awesome intro, to the solid level design and solid gunplay for it's time, 
    Killzone is an absolute gem I wish playstation/Guerrilla would bring back. The 
    "Halo Killer" isn't anything like it's competition, but feels pretty unique especially
    with the helghast faction. Gunplay and movement isn't as smooth as halo ce, but still - 
    feels good for the times. Being able to pick 1/4 characters each level is nice and something -
    I wish Killzone 2 carried over same with being able to have 2 primary weapons. Solid game 9/10
